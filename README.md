# Ktor_Example
Ktor is an asynchronous open source framework for creating microservices and web applications.
It was developed with Kotlin by Jetbrains.
It’s easy to install and use, It’s extensible if you want to add a step to the execution pipeline.
Its asynchronous property allows it to receive multiple requests thanks to coroutines and it is also multiplatform.

Ktor is multiplatform, yes multiplatform! It means that we can deploy Ktor applications anywhere,
and not only as a server, but we can also consume microservices on Android, iOS, or JS with Ktor Client
. Ktor Client allows you to make requests and handle responses, extend its functionality with features,
such as authentication, JSON serialization, and so on.
